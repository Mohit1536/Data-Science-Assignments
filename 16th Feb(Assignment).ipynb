    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are used to store and manage various types of data, such as customer information, financial records, inventory, and more. They are widely used in various industries, including healthcare, banking, education, and e-commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (relational) databases and NoSQL (non-relational) databases. Here are the differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Structure:\n",
    "SQL databases store data in tables, which are composed of rows and columns, with each column representing a specific type of data. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use various data structures such as key-value, document-based, graph, or column-oriented databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability:\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle more data by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle more data by adding more servers to a distributed database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Consistency:\n",
    "SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, meaning that data is always up-to-date and reliable. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, prioritize performance and may not guarantee strong consistency, which means that data may not be up-to-date at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Query Language:\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve and manipulate data. NoSQL databases use various query languages, such as MongoDB's JSON-based query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Usage:\n",
    "SQL databases are typically used for applications that require a high level of data consistency, such as financial applications, where accuracy is critical. NoSQL databases are commonly used in web applications, social media, and big data applications where high scalability and performance are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right type of database depends on the specific requirements of your application."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a subset of SQL used to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the most common DDL commands and their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: This command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, the following SQL code creates a new table named \"employees\" with three columns: \"id\", \"name\", and \"salary\".\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: This command is used to delete a database object. For example, the following SQL code drops the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following SQL code adds a new column named \"department\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: This command is used to remove all the data from a table. It is similar to the DELETE command, but it is faster and does not log individual row deletions. For example, the following SQL code removes all the data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL commands are used to create, modify, or delete the structure of database objects. These commands are essential for managing the schema of a database, and they allow developers to define the structure of tables and other objects, and modify them as needed."

    "Primary key and foreign key are two important concepts in relational database design. Here's an explanation of both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary key: A primary key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is used to enforce the integrity of the data in the table and ensure that each row can be uniquely identified. A primary key cannot have a NULL value and must be unique for each row in the table. Common examples of primary keys include unique ID numbers or social security numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"customers\" table with columns \"id\", \"name\", \"email\", and \"phone\". If we choose to use the \"id\" column as the primary key, each row in the \"customers\" table will have a unique \"id\" value, and the database will enforce this constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign key: A foreign key is a column or group of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables and ensure referential integrity in the database. A foreign key column can have duplicate values and can have NULL values, but if a value is present, it must correspond to an existing primary key in the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"orders\" table with columns \"id\", \"customer_id\", \"product\", and \"price\". If we want to establish a relationship between the \"orders\" table and the \"customers\" table, we can create a foreign key on the \"customer_id\" column, which references the primary key of the \"customers\" table. This ensures that each order in the \"orders\" table corresponds to a valid customer in the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. These concepts are important in relational database design and help to ensure the integrity of the data and the relationships between tables."
