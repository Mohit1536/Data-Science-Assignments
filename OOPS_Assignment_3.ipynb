    "\n",
    "\"w\" (write mode): This mode opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (exclusive creation mode): This mode creates a new file, but if the file already exists, it raises a FileExistsError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode): This mode opens a file for appending. If the file already exists, it opens the file and places the cursor at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (binary mode): This mode opens a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like image files.\n",

    "In Python, when you open a file using the open() function, the operating system allocates certain resources to the file, such as memory and CPU time. These resources are finite and should be used judiciously. If you keep a file open unnecessarily, it can lead to resource wastage, which can cause performance issues for your program or even lead to system instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() method is used to release these resources and free them up for other programs to use. When you call the close() method, it signals to the operating system that you are done with the file and it can release the resources associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to close a file properly after you're done working with it, especially if you have written to the file. This is because the data you've written might still be in the buffer waiting to be written to the file, and if you don't close the file, it might not get written at all. This could result in incomplete or corrupted data being written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if you don't close the file, you may run into problems if you try to reopen the file later in your program. Some operating systems limit the number of files that can be open simultaneously, so if you don't close the files you've opened, you may reach that limit and be unable to open any more files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these issues, it's good practice to always close a file after you've finished working with it. In Python, you can close a file by calling the close() method on the file object:\n",
