    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behavior that objects of that class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of the class with its own unique properties and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class called \"Car\" that defines the properties and behavior of a car. The Car class might have properties such as \"make\", \"model\", \"year\", and \"color\", and methods such as \"start\", \"accelerate\", and \"stop\". An object of the Car class would be an actual car with specific values for each property, and the ability to perform each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we create two instances of the Car class, each will have its own unique properties and behavior. One car might be a red 2022 Toyota Corolla that can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 8 seconds, while another car might be a blue 2023 Honda Civic that can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 7 seconds. Both of these cars are objects of the Car class, with their own unique properties and behavior."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: It is a mechanism of bundling the data and methods that operate on that data, and restricting access to the inner workings of the object. This helps to achieve data hiding, and protects the object from unwanted interference or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: It refers to the process of hiding the complexity of the system and providing a simplified interface to the users. It allows the user to interact with the system at a high level without having to understand the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: It is a mechanism of creating a new class from an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class and can also add new properties and methods to it. It allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOPs, it refers to the ability of an object to have multiple behaviors or forms. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class, and enables the implementation of functions that can be applied to objects of different types."
