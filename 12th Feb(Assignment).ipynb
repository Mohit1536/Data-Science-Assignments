    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of a program is disrupted, and the program terminates with an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are typically caused by unexpected or erroneous situations in a program. Examples of common exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, and KeyError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter is unable to parse or understand the code in a program. Syntax errors are typically caused by missing or incorrect punctuation, misspelled keywords, or other mistakes in the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed, while exceptions occur during program execution. In other words, a syntax error prevents the program from running at all, while an exception can occur while the program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised in a Python program, it can be caught and handled using a try-except block. This allows the program to continue running even if an exception occurs, by providing an alternate path for the program to follow. Syntax errors, on the other hand, must be fixed before the program can be executed at all."
